# Design and Simulate controlling an LED 7-Segment Display with Raspberry Pi.

## Aim 
To implement display of numbers in 7 segment using Raspberry Pi

## Procedure
A seven segment display is a simple displaying device that uses 8 LEDs to display decimal numerals. It is generally used in digital clocks, calculators, electronic meters, and other devices that displays numerical information.

A seven segment display has 8 LEDs in it. Each LED is controlled through specific pin. It is made of seven different illuminating segments which are arranged in such a way that it can form the numbers from 0-9 by displaying different combinations of segments. It is also able to form some alphabets like A, B, C, H, F, E, G, DP.

These can be two type common anode and common cathode. In common cathode type the cathode is common for all 8 LEDs and in common anode type the anode is common for all 8 LEDs. A seven segment display has 10 pin interface, 2 pins are for Common and 8 pins are for each LED. Both common pins are internally shorted.

The RPi.GPIO is used to import and to the OUTPUT or INPUT mode of a pin action is mentioned then OUT / IN is used to 

Open the editor thonny , type the program code to perform , write Python 3 file_name.py > Press Enter. (.py is file extension).click on run-button.
