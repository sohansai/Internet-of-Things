# Flame Sensor Arduino Project

## Aim
To perform an alarm when a fire is detected using FlameSensor with a photodiode and coding in Arduino.

## Procedure
The flame sensor detects the presence of fire or flame based on the Infrared (IR) wavelength emitted by the flame. It gives logic 1 as output if a flame is detected, otherwise, it gives logic 0 as output. Arduino Uno checks the logic level on the output pin of the sensor and performs further tasks such as activating the buzzer and LED, sending an alert message.

## Flame Sensor and Connectivity
A flame detector is a sensor designed to detect and respond to the presence of a flame or fire. Responses to a detected flame depend on the installation but can include sounding an alarm, deactivating a fuel line (such as a propane or a natural gas line), and activating a fire suppression system. The IR Flame sensor used in this project is shown below; these sensors are also called Fire sensor module or flame detector sensor sometimes. We are using an IR based flame sensor.

### Pin Description
- Vcc: 3.3 â€“ 5V power supply
- GND: Ground
- Dout: Digital output

## Applications
Flame Sensors are very important devices in detecting fire and they can be used in a variety of applications/areas like:
- Hydrogen stations
- Combustion monitors for burners
- Oil and gas pipelines
- Automotive manufacturing facilities
- Nuclear facilities
- Aircraft hangars
- Turbine enclosures
- Car or Automobile
- Fire Fighting Robots
- Garage Safety Equipment
- Warehouses

## Components Required
- Arduino Uno (any Arduino board can be used)
- Flame sensor module
- LED
- Buzzer
- Resistor
- Jumper wires

## Circuit Diagram
The below image is the Arduino fire sensor circuit diagram, it shows how to interface the fire sensor module with Arduino.
